# AhoyDTU
AhoyDTU for Raspberry-Pi with NGINX WebServices

This project is a partial copy of https://github.com/lumapu/ahoy/

Since the beginning of 2024, Ahoy has only been programmed for ESP processors. 
For this project, version v0.8.155 was copied and adapted to use on a Raspberry-Pi. 

The goal is to use a web-server (NGINX) and zero power consumption when using a battery.
